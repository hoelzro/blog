Here are some random, but cool, features that I (fREW) really enjoy:

## `push-line`

I bound the `q` key in the `vicmd` mode to `push-line` like this:

```
bindkey -M vicmd "q" push-line
```

What this does is set aside the current commandline, give you a fresh
commandline to modify, and then pop the current line back.  I typically use it
in situations like this:

```
$ vi some/dir/some/file<ESC>q
$ mkdir -p some/dir/some/
$ vi some/dir/some/file
```

## `AUTO_PUSHD`

In both zsh and bash you can use `pushd some/dir` to change directory into
`some/dir`, and then if you use `popd` you'll change directory back to where
you came from.  If you set the `AUTO_PUSHD` option, `cd` will automatically
`pushd` for you.  I'll then use `popd` (or my alias for it, the symettrical
`mk`) to get back to where I started.

## global aliases

In `zsh` you can have aliases that are allowed anywhere in a commandline.  I
use `G` and `L` constantly below, and always forget that I've defined `V` even
though I do that action manually a lot:

```
alias -g G="| grep"
alias -g L="| $PAGER"
alias -g V="| vim -"
```

Example:

```
$ long-out-is-long G needle # finds lines matching needle
$ curl https://blog.afoolishmanifest.com/ L # runs with pager
```

You can also pass arguments!  This works fine:

```
$ ls G -P '^f'
```
